- 👋 Hi, I’m @brunrama
- 👀 I’m interested in Financial Models based in Python and Generative AI APIs for work automatization (using Python libraries).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and the using of AI tools to increase productivity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Financial models (discuss and contribute to get better insights for trade performance) and learn more about AI.
